Sprint 2

Instance #39 on the libping library does not seem to be accepting contributions. There have been no issues resolved, it has been innactive for years and there is no documentation for it. 

Instance #3 on the lightpd library also seems to not be accepting contributions. This project is innactive since there hasnt been commits or issues on a while. Also it seems the only push made to this project was to initialize the repo.


Sprint 3

Instance #39 After looking at the code that fix this vulnerability this library did not seem to fix it. In order to determine this I cloned the repo with the given hash for the commit and compared it to the repo that had the commi that resolved the vulnerability and noticed that this repo did not succeed.

Instance #3 Once again I compared the files in this repo to the files of the repo in which the vulnerability was foxed and was able to detemrine that it did not fix the vulnerability. Additionally this repo seems to have only imported the files, not change them.

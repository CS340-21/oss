Sprint 2

Instance #39 on the libping library does not seem to be accepting contributions. There have been no issues resolved, it has been innactive for years and there is no documentation for it. 

Instance #3 on the lightpd library also seems to not be accepting contributions. This project is innactive since there hasnt been commits or issues on a while. Also it seems the only push made to this project was to initialize the repo.

#Sprint 1
For my projects, I was assigned [instance 558](https://github.com/SuperEver/snb-vision) and [instance 476](https://github.com/antoine2000/TDL). I checked 
the number of participants and the frequency of commits and issues to determine if these two projects were still active.

###Instance 558: SuperEver/snb-vision
I could not not find a number of participants, and unfortunately this project has no README. Because there have not been any new commits or changes to this
project in thirteen months, I think that it was either finished over a year ago or has been abandoned. It is probably no longer active.

###Instance 476: antoine2000/TDL
Interestly, this entire project is in French I think. I have no idea what they were trying to do, but I'm pretty sure they finished because the last commit
to be added was called "final commit!" which seems pretty final. There have also been no more commits for a year. I therefore think that this project is
no longer active. 

###Conclusion
Neither of my projects seem to be active any longer, and I have no idea what one them was meant to do at all because it was in a different language.

#Sprint 2
For this sprint, I determined if these projects are still accepting contributions. 

###Instance 558: SuperEver/snb-vision
Since this project has no issues, milestones, or commits that I could find, I believe that this project is no longer accepting contributions. I also 
could not find any list of contributors or participants. 

###Instance 476: antoine2000/TDL
Since this project is entirely in a different language, possibly French, I'm not sure how to get in contact with the contributors because of the 
language barrier. I also believe that this project was completed because the last commit is from a year ago and is titled "final commit!"

###Conclusion
I believe that neither of my projects are accepting contributions any longer.

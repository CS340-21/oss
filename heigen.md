# Sprint 1

### Sauce3D (instance 911)
This is a 3d rendering engine for a larger graphics engine project.
This project is not active. The last commit was nearly a year ago and there are no issues. In addition, there are no forks being developed. 
Github lists no dependants using this project, so it is of no interest to anyone other than the sole contributer who has stopped working on it.

### amiga-utils (instance 996)
This is an Amiga project for assembly.
This project seems to be in active development. It has had steady commits for several years.

# Sprint 2

### Sauce3D (instance 911)

There are no pull requests, forks, or issues. The creator is the sole contributor. The creator has only had activity on Github twice in the last year, so even if he/she were open to contributions, it's unknown whether they will log on to see them.

### amiga-utils (instance 996)

There are no pull requests or forks. I did see one issue asking about the license, so it seems like the project might be used by someone outside of the creator. The creator is the sole contributor, however he/she is relatively active on github, so they might be open to contributions.

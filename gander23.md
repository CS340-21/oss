This instance is not active as in the github code there have not been changes made for over a year and most files haven't been changed in 3 years. The commits were also only made by a single user, making me question if this project accepts contributions. The vulnerability has not been solved as when I compared the file in the instance to the vulnerability fix I noticed the changes were not added to the file.

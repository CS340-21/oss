Instance 16:

Sprint 1 - This instance is not active as in the github code there have not been changes made for over a year and most files haven't been changed in 3 years. 

Sprint 2 - The commits were also only made by a single user, making me question if this project accepts contributions. The nearest update on this project was made almost a year ago at this point, and there have been no pull request added to the project at this time, leading me to believe that this project most likely won't accept contributions, but it is not impossible. 

Sprint 3 - The vulnerability has not been solved as when I compared the file in the instance to the vulnerability fix I noticed the changes were not added to the file.

Sprint 4&5 - I was able to make the patch for this Instance but I was unable to clone the repo, when I attempted to do so Iw as met with the following error "fatal: unable to checkout working tree
warning: Clone succeeded, but checkout failed."

Instance 978:

Sprint 1 - This instance is not active as in the github code there have not been changes made for about 11 months. The commits were also only made by a single user, making me wonder if this project accepts contributions. 

Sprint 2 - Looking at the issues, we can see that dependabot has 5 pull request for bumps in different depedancies, none of which have been addressed, leading me to conclude the project most likely does not accept contributions. The final nail in the coffin is the fact that the description labels this as a "final year project" meaning it most likely won't be looked at again anytime soon. 

Sprint 3 - The vulnerability has not been resolved as when I compared the file in the instance to the vulnerability fix I noticed the changes were not added to the file.

Sprint 4&5 - I fixed the vulnerabilities present in the code and made a PR at https://github.com/Samp21/FYP/pull/8

The criteria I will use to determined whether the OSS projects are still active include the number of active participants in the project, the date of the last commit to the project, how many commits were made in the past couple of months, whether open issues exist on the project, whether there are pull requests, and whether there is community discussion about the project.

beaumanvienna / marley (Instance 552)

This project appears to be active. The last commit was 17 hours ago, meaning the developer has contributed very recently. Just in the current month, there has been 29 commits. However, this project appears to be mostly the work of one person. There are 3 listed contributors, of the 3, 2 of them have no more than 3 commits while one of them has over 600. Several open issues have been opened on the project, and a sizeable amount of discussion has occured on most of them. However, no milestones exist. There is also one pull request. Therefore, I can conclude that this is an active project.


sagpant / freeablo (Instance 204)

This project appears to be inactive. The last commit was made in June 12, 2020. However, the project has over 1,700 commits and 28 contributors, meaning it was very active in the past. However, there are no issues, pull requests, or community discussion apparent on the GitHub page. However, the README.md points to a similar repository under a different account with far more open issues and discussion, along with pull requests, meaning this repo may be a fork (however it is not explicitly specified on the GitHub page). The other repo's last commit is also June 12, 2020, meaning both repos are most likely not active. Therefore, I can conclude that this is an inactive project.

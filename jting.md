# Methods and Criteria

## Sprint 1
The criteria I will use to determined whether the OSS projects are still active include the number of active participants in the project, the date of the last commit to the project, how many commits were made in the past couple of months, whether open issues exist on the project, whether there are pull requests, and whether there is community discussion about the project.

## Sprint 2
The criteria I will use for determining whether they are accepting contributions is recent commit activity, whether there are multiple developers contributing, whether pull requests have been accepted in the past, and whether the readme has a section on contributions.

## Sprint 3
The method to determining whether the vulnerability still exists is by checking the commit that fixes the vulnerability, and comparing the code in that commit to the code in the potentially vulnerable project. If the project is missing the code, the vulnerability still exists.

# beaumanvienna / marley (Instance 552)

## Sprint 1
This project appears to be active. The last commit was 17 hours ago, meaning the developer has contributed very recently. Just in the current month, there has been 29 commits. However, this project appears to be mostly the work of one person. There are 3 listed contributors, of the 3, 2 of them have no more than 3 commits while one of them has over 600. Several open issues have been opened on the project, and a sizeable amount of discussion has occured on most of them. However, no milestones exist. There is also one pull request. Therefore, I can conclude that this is an active project.

## Sprint 2
There have been commits relatively recently, as specified in Sprint 1. There are multiple developers contributing. There have also been 7 pull requests accepted in the past. The readme also specifies that pull requests are welcome. Therefore, I can conclude this project is accepting contributions

## Sprint 3
Cross-referencing the libpng/pngread.c file from libpng to dolphin/Externals/libpng/pngpread.c in marley, it appears to have been fixed yet as pngpread.c contains the updated code.

# skarik / 1Engine (Instance 552)

## Sprint 1
This project appears to be active. The last commit was on March 7th, meaning the developer has contributed fairly recently. Activity is fairly slow, as there have only been 5 commits in the last 2-3 months.. There are 3 listed contributors, of the 3, 2 of them have no more than 17 commits while one of them has over 450. No open issues have been opened on the project, same with milestones exist. There is also one closed pull request. Therefore, I can conclude that this is an active project.

## Sprint 2
There have been commits relatively recently, as specified in Sprint 1. There are multiple developers contributing. There has been 1 pull requests accepted in the past. Therefore, I can conclude this project is accepting contributions

## Sprint 3
Cross-referencing the libpng/pngread.c file from libpng to oneEngine/oneGame/source-lib/png/pngpread.c in 1Engine, it appears to not have been fixed yet as pngread.c does not contain the updated code.

## Sprint 4
Patches have been created, fixing the vulnerability in pngpread.c and pngrutil.c in the 1Engine project.

# wheybags / freeablo (Instance 204)

## Sprint 1
This project appears to be inactive. The last commit was made in June 12, 2020. However, the project has over 1,700 commits and 28 contributors, meaning it was very active in the past. However, there are no issues, pull requests, or community discussion apparent on the GitHub page. However, there are 299 closed pull requests and 28 contributors. It seems that it was active in the past. Therefore, I can conclude that this is an inactive project.

## Sprint 2
There have not been commits in nearly a year. There are multiple developers contributing. There are 3 open pull requests and 299 closed pull requests, but they all were made in 2020 or before. The readme does have a section on contributions. However, due to the lack of commits and accepted pull request in a recent timeframe, I conclude that this project is not accepting contributions.

## Sprint 3
Cross-referencing the libpng/pngread.c file from libpng to extern/libpng/pngpread.c in freeablo, it appears to not have been fixed yet as pngpread.c does not contain the updated code.

## Sprint 4
Patches have been created, fixing the vulnerability in pngpread.c and pngrutil.c in the freeablo project.

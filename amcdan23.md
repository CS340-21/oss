# Sprint 1
I was assigned [github.com/damonyan1985/Boymue](github.com/damonyan1985/Boymue) and [https://github.com/ycwang812/SLAMCar](https://github.com/ycwang812/SLAMCar)

## damonyan1985/Boymue

This project is surely inactive because the GitHub page has been removed entirely: the link only directs to the 404 page. As a result, I can't say for certain what the project was about or what its purpose was.

## ycwang812/SLAMCar

This project is also likely inactive. The latest commit is from 11 months ago, and it was an update to the README, which only contains 1 line.

I'm guessing this project was an attempt to use the SLAM algorithms to drive a robot autonomously, as there are folders such as `PHOENIXEngine`, which are robotics libraries. SLAM is also the name of a collection of algorithms to determine the position of a robot at all times with sensory information, and is used to drive robots autonomously.

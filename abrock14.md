# **Sprint 1**
I have been assigned project 121 [Deep Linking for Android](https://github.com/totvslabs/samples-mobile) and project 1389 [EngineDeps](https://github.com/MogreBindings/EngineDeps/).
For both of these projects, I have taken note of their contributors, commits, and pull requests, as well as the dates of the latter two.
### **Project 121: Deep Linking for Android**
This project has two contributors. It was first released on **Feb 13, 2019** and has since had 7 more releases, with the most recent being **Dec 6, 2019**. There have since been no further commits or pull requests. The rapid development and release of this repository over 2019 with lack of attention for 2020 or 2021 seems to suggest that the project is not actively maintained.
### **Project 1389: EngineDeps**
This project has no contributors or releases published. The first commit was on **Jul 22, 2010** by a now deleted account named Michael. It had three more commits by this user, with the most recent being **Aug 17, 2010**. The repository has had one more commit since then, by the owner account MogreBindings. This commit was on **Jun 30, 2020**. This large gap between commits seems to suggest that while updates are minimal, the project is being actively maintained.

# **Sprint 2**
### **Project 121: Deep Linking for Android**
Based on the information from Sprint 1, particularly the number of releases and contributors, it can be assumed that the project will accept contributions.
### **Project 1389: EngineDeps**
Based on the information from Sprint 1, it can be not be assumed that the project accepts contributions. Since no pull requests have been made and no contributors exist, it is difficult to discern if the original author allows contributions.

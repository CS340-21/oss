# Sprint 1
My projects are ZenonEngine(https://github.com/bouzi71/ZenonEngine) and FirmAFL(https://github.com/zyw-200/FirmAFL). In order to determine if they were active, I examined the latest commit history, number of open/closed pull requests, number of open/closed issues, and the latest project release.

### ZenonEngine Project (Instance 464)
This project is a DirectX 11 and OpenGL open source 3D enigne. 

This project seems to be an active project. However, this project only has one contributor. There is only one issue, but it is closed. There are no pull requests. The repository was last updated February 28th, 2021. There are three forks, but since there are no open or closed pull requests, it is obvious there are no other contributors. So it is not clear, if this project would accept any contributions.

### FirmAFL Project (Instance 5)
This project is a high-throughput greybox fuzzer for IoT firmware. FIRM-AFL addresses two fundamental problems in IoT fuzzing. It addresses compatiblity issues by enabling fuzzing for POSIX-compatible firmware that can be emulated in a system emulator. It also addresses the performance bottleneck caused by system-mode emulation with a technique called "augmented process emualtion."

This project does not seem to be active. It has 41 total issues, but only 10 of them are closed. There are 3 pull requests and none of them are closed. This project also only has one contibutor. It is not clear if this project would accept contributions either, since none of the pull requests have been closed. This project also does not have a commit since October 21st, 2020.

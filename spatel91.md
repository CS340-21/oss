Sprint 2

libpng - (Instance 820)

After examining this git repo, i came to the conclusion that this project still accepts contributions. Some of the most recent commits were done by three different contributors, who were relatively new contributors according to the commit history.

QEMU - (Instance 8)

This project also appears to accept contributions because the webstie states "QEMU welcomes contributions of code (either fixing bugs or adding new functionality)". However inorder to contribute to this project you have to submit a bug inquiry on their bug report page or submit patches to the website.

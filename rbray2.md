# Sprint 1
For Sprint 1, I was assigned instances 1101 and 869.  

## Instance 1101:   Ultraschall/ultraschall-soundboard    
My first vulnerability is for a project called Ultraschall-Soundboard (Ultrasonic in English), which is a soundboard   
that can be used by podcasters, according to the README. It seems fairly active, since the last commit was eight days   
ago, and there seems to be a few commits every month. It also has eleven open issues right now, one of them to make   
the README more descriptive, and it has nine closed issues. I think this project is fairly active by these criteria.
  
## Instance 869:   slowrunner/Carl   
The second vulnerability is for a project called Carl, which is a the code for running a robot named Carl, who has a   
minion on top of him. This project seems very active, since there were thirteen commits in the last month, and this project   
has existed since 2018. There are no open issues, but that seems to be more because there is only one contributor than a   
sign of inactivity, since there are so many comits.
   
# Sprint 2   

## Instance 1101:   Ultraschall/ultraschall-soundboard   
It seems like this project is still accepting pull requests, since the last one was merged on February 16. It seems   
feasible that they would still accept contributions from a new person.

## Instance 869:   slowrunner/Carl   
It does not look like this project is accepting pull requests, since the only contributions have been made by one person,   
and there are currently none open. This person may be open to having contributions, since they are so active, but it is likely   
that they just want to work on their robot alone.

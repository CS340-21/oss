# **Sprint 1**

I was assigned Libpng and Lighttpd. I looked at the commit history, open/closed pull requests and open/closed issues, and project releases to determine if the project 
was still in active developement.

### ProjetKF Project (Instance 55)
The project's goal was to create a software able to animate a 3D mesh with live recorded facial expressions.

Judging by the fact that there has not been a commit in 11 months and there are no pull requests or issues, I'd say the project is not active.
### DIR882A1-GPL Project (Instance 1)
There is no file that acutally describes what this project is. It is just several dozen code files with no comments.

Every file was commited on January 2nd 2020 by one author along with a single release. It does not seem like this project was ever active, the author seemed to use github to store a personal product that they have no intention of updating.

# **Sprint 1**

I was assigned Libpng and Lighttpd. I looked at the commit history, open/closed pull requests and open/closed issues, and project releases to determine if the project 
was still in active developement.

### libpng Project (Instance 55)
Libng is a Portable Network Graphics reference library. It is a platform-independent library that contains C functions for handling PNG images.

There was one recent commit 5 days ago, but that was a very small change (removing a single space). Other than that, the most recent commits are from 10-11 months 
ago. That combined with the number of open issues and pull requests leads me to believe that this project is not very active anymore.

### Lighttpd Project (Instance 1)
Lighttpd is a light weight web server.

The link to the project brought me to a website rather than a github page, but it appears the last update was seven years ago, leading me to believe the project 
is not active.

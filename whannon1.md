# Sprint 1
I was assigned instance 344 (https://github.com/michas2/l4re-snapshot) and instance 819 (https://github.com/moebuii/asuswrt_qca9563_yoru)

### l4re-snapshot :
I do not believe this project is active. On the criteria of participation and frequency of commits, this project meets neither.

### asuswrt_qca9563_yoru :
This project is a dead GitHub link, which I believe is criteria enough to determine that this project is inactive.

# Sprint 2
### l4re-snapshot :
I don't think this project is still accepting contributions. There was only ever a single commit made, the first one, in 2016. 
This appears to me to be a kind of "one-and-done" project, of which there is no need for further committing.

### asuswrt_qca9563_yoru :
Again, the GitHub link for this project is dead. It is incapable of accepting further contributions.

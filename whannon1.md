# Sprint 1
I was assigned instance 344 (https://github.com/michas2/l4re-snapshot) and instance 819 (https://github.com/moebuii/asuswrt_qca9563_yoru)

### l4re-snapshot :
I do not believe this project is active. On the criteria of participation and frequency of commits, this project meets neither.

### asuswrt_qca9563_yoru :
This project is a dead GitHub link, which I believe is criteria enough to determine that this project is inactive.

# Sprint 2
### l4re-snapshot :
I don't think this project is still accepting contributions. There was only ever a single commit made, the first one, in 2016. 
This appears to me to be a kind of "one-and-done" project, of which there is no need for further committing.

### asuswrt_qca9563_yoru :
Again, the GitHub link for this project is dead. It is incapable of accepting further contributions.

# Sprint 3
### l4re-snapshot :
The two files I have been assigned to look at are src/l4/pkg/libpng/lib/contrib/pngpread.c and src/l4/pkg/libpng/lib/contrib/pngrutil.c
The vulnerability still exists in both files. In comparing them to their counterparts in https://github.com/glennrp/libpng/commit/347538efbdc21b8df684ebd92d37400b3ce85d55, they do not reflect the additions made to counteract the vulnerability.

### asuswrt_qca9563_yoru :
Again, the GitHub link for this project is dead. 

# Sprint 4
### l4re-snapshot :
To patch src/l4/pkg/libpng/lib/contrib/pngpread.c, the additions shown in https://github.com/glennrp/libpng/commit/347538efbdc21b8df684ebd92d37400b3ce85d55
would nead to be added. The same goes for src/l4/pkg/libpng/lib/contrib/pngrutil.c, the patch would be the additions shown in https://github.com/glennrp/libpng/commit/347538efbdc21b8df684ebd92d37400b3ce85d55.

### asuswrt_qca9563_yoru :
Again, the GitHub link for this project is dead. 

# Sprint 5
### l4re-snapshot :
I successfully created pull requests to patch src/l4/pkg/libpng/lib/contrib/pngpread.c and src/l4/pkg/libpng/lib/contrib/pngrutil.c, located at https://github.com/michas2/l4re-snapshot/pull/2 and https://github.com/michas2/l4re-snapshot/pull/3, respectively.
### asuswrt_qca9563_yoru :
Again, the GitHub link for this project is dead. 

# Sprint 5
### l4re-snapshot :
I don't think any questions are necessary for my proposed patches, but I will update this if that changes.

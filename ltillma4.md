## Sprint 1 

I have been assigned the projects [Driver-Drowsiness-Detector](https://github.com/aswinkumarpm/Driver-Drowsiness-Detector) (Instance 131) and [ImageViewer](https://github.com/AlienCowEatCake/ImageViewer) (Instance 258). To determine if these projects are still active, I looked at the recent commits, releases, and pull requests.

### Driver-Drowsiness-Detector (131)

The latest changes to the code took place 14 months ago. There seem to be no active pull requests and no releases. Due to these factors, I believe this project is no longer active in development.

### ImageViewer (258)

This latest changes for this project took place in January. There are no current pull requests but the most recent release was in December 2020. This project seems to be active in development.

## Sprint 2

### Driver-Drowsiness-Detector

I have determined this project is not accepting contributions since there have been zero pull requests and only one contributor. It is also no longer active.

### ImageViewer

I don't believe this project is accepting contributions since there have not been any issues or pull requests. There is also only one contributor, but it is in active development.

## Sprint 3

### Driver-Drowsiness-Detector

After comparing the libpng commit for both `pngpread.c` and `pngrutil.c` to the respective file in the Driver-Drowsiness-Detector repo, I have confirmed this vulnerability still exists.

### ImageViewer

Comparing the fixes with the files in the ImageViewer repo (like above), I have determined the vulnerability still exists in this repo as well.

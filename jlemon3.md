# Sprint 1

The projects I have discovered are titled [Marley](https://github.com/beaumanvienna/marley) and [Progression](https://github.com/LiamTyler/Progression). My criteria
to determine if they are active include exploring:
- the recency of the latest commits and issues
- the number of issues open and closed
- the number of PRs open and closed
- the project milestones and releases.

## Marley (instance 321)

This is a bundle of gaming console emulators for the x86_64 Linux platform, licensed under the GPL-3.0 License. It stands for 
"Many Awesome Retro Linux Emulators, Yay!"

It seems to be an active project, with the latest commit on March 14, 2021 as of writing this document. It has 13 open issues, with 8 of them being opened this year
and 5 in the last week. 4 issues were solved this year. The project doesn't seem to make use of pull requests, milestones, or releases.

## Progression (instance 2)

This is a C++ game engine for Linux and Windows, licensed under the MIT License.

It also seems to be active, with the latest commit on February 13, 2021. It only has one contributor who does not make use of issues, pull requests, milestones,
or releases.

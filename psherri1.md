##Sprint 1

I was assigned [Cross-platform calculator](https://github.com/Rohan-cod/cross_platform_calc) and [LZWolf](https://github.com/madmodder123/lzwolf-sdl2) as my two OSS projects.

The criteria I've used to determine if the two projeccts are still active are as follows:
- The number of participants
- Frequency of code
- Project milestones and issues
- Activity from the community, including project releases

## Not actively accepting contributions
      The criteria for wether or not the a project is actively accepting contributions is very similar to the criteria for wether or not the project is still
      active. Since this project has not had a commit in almost a year, it is safe to say that this project is no longer accepting commits. There are also only 8
      commits total and they were all commited by the owner of the repo.

## (sprint 2) Not actively accepting contributions
      The criteria for wether or not the a project is actively accepting contributions is very similar to the criteria for wether or not the project is still
      active. Since this project has not had a commit in almost a year, it is safe to say that this project is no longer accepting commits. There are also only 8
      commits total and they were all commited by the owner of the repo.
## (Sprint 3) The patch has not been added to the project
      I cross checked the updated file in the Libpng library with the corresponding file in the CxImage project. The lines that were added in the Libpgn version
      were missing for both the pngpread.c and pngrutil.c files.
      
## (Sprint 4) I added the patches to pngpread.c and pngrutil.c
[pngpread.c](https://github.com/JGray17/CxImage/blob/master/sources/png/pngpread.c)\
[pngrutil.c](https://github.com/JGray17/CxImage/blob/master/sources/png/pngrutil.c)

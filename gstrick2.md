I have used the date of the last commit, amount of contributors, presence of issues and milestones, and the presence of community discussions to determine if the following projects are active. 

Algonquin - Game Dev (Instance 230)

It appears that this project is not especially active and may not be open to active contributions. The latest commit for this repo was 12 months ago. It was active January 2, 2020 to March 19, 2020. This project also appears to be in the early stages of development shown by the lack of multiple contributors and lack of previous versions of the project. The most recent version of the project is 1.0.0 which is the first release of this project. There does not seem to be any community discussion on the material present. Issues and Milestones are also not present in this repo. The only contributor to this project is floodb. Given all these factors, I would conclude that this is not an active project.

Lucmichalski (Instance 1)

This project does not appear to be very active. The last commit to this repo was 10 months ago. It appears to have only been active one day; everything was added to the repo on May 12, 2020. It does have multiple contributors which could help the probability of getting in contact with them and working collaboratively on this project. The project appears to be in early stages of development. It lacks multiple releases and versions of the project. There does not appear to be any community discussion on any of the code in the repo. Issues and Milestones are also not present. Based on all these factors, I would conclude that this project is not active.

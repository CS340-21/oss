# Sprint 1

    I've been assigned instance 713 - which is Apple-Tcl-Mirror and instance 1325 - Attendance-via-face-Recognition  

    Both repositories only have one commit and they are both commits approximately a year old.  
    Neither repositiory has active issues or milestones. (or even closed issues or milestones).  

    There is only one branch for both and there appears to be only one contributor for both.  

    All of these combined leads me to believe that neither of my assigned repositories are active.
    
 # Sprint 2
 
    For all of the above reasons given I believe both of these projects to be inactive, and therefore not accepting  
    new contributions.

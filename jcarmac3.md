# Sprint 1

I've been assigned instance 713 - which is Apple-Tcl-Mirror and instance 1325 - Attendance-via-face-Recognition

Both repositories only have one commit and they are both commits approximately a year old.
Neither repositiory has active issues or milestones. (or even closed issues or milestones).

There is only one branch for both and there appears to be only one contributor for both.

All of these combined leads me to believe that neither of my assigned repositories are active.

# Sprint 2

For all of the above reasons given I believe both of these projects to be inactive, and therefore not accepting
new contributions.

# Sprint 3

Instance 713 appears to be using a version of libpng from 2007 -- the vulernability still exists and the
files in question are vastly different. I simply compared the files to determin this.

Instance 1325 still contains the vulnerability and will simply require a few copy/pastes to patch it.
Again, I simply compared the files with a diff.

# Sprint 4

I produced a patch for 1325. It's found in [this](https://github.com/Pokemonpower92/Attendance_via_face_Recognition/) repo.

Instance 713 seems like a lost cause because it relies on a depreciated version of libpng  
and the rest of the files wopuld require extensive changes to patch.

# Sprint 5

Created this [pull request](https://github.com/upreverie/Attendance_via_face_Recognition/pull/2)

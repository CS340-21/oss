# Sprint 1

## Criteria

I looked at the amount of open/closed pull requests and commits, as well as the latest release, amount of contributors, and the amount of issues (and whether or not the maintainers respond) to determine whether these software projects are still in development.

## libpng (instance 398)

Libpng is a library of C functions used for handling PNG images. There are 83 open issues and 23 open pull requests; there does appear to one person responding to some of the issues and reviewing and/or merging some of the pull requests. The latest release was on July 16, 2018, and there does seem to be a decent amount of community involvement, judging by the 47 contrubitors and amount of issues. Based on these criteria, I determine this project to be lightly active.

## qemu (instance 6)

This repo is a read-only mirror of the original QEMU, which is a virtual machine emulator. Since it is a read-only mirror, all pull requests are automatically rejected by a bot. There seems to be a good amount of community involvment, due to the 1121 contributors and 112 (rejected) pull requests, but due to all PRs being auto rejected, it's hard to tell if the maintainers are actively accepting contributions at this time. There are no issues in the repository, and over the last year there have been aorund 15 pull requests (auto-rejected). Judging by this, I conclude that this project is mostly inactive.

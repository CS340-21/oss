# Sprint 1

## Criteria

I looked at the amount of open/closed pull requests and commits, as well as the latest release, amount of contributors, and the amount of issues (and whether or not the maintainers respond) to determine whether these software projects are still in development.

## libpng (instance 398)

Libpng is a library of C functions used for handling PNG images. This repository uses this code in reference to making  plugins for the synth Percussa SSP. There are no open issues or pull requests, and only appears to be one contributor, the owner of the repo. This repo seems to be soley used and maintained by one contributor (who was active from June to October of last year), since then, this repo hasn't had a commit. Based on these criteria, I determine this project to be inactive.

## qemu (instance 6)

This repo is concerned with creating a better fuzzing protocol for finding bugs/security issues in software. There are 16 contributors, but there are no issues  or pull requests listed in the repository. For my instance, there hasn't been a commit since August of 2020. There is however, a google group that appears to be active, with a steady influx of questions/patches being submitted for review. Based on this, I have determiend that this project is active

# Sprint 2

## Criteria

I looked at the amount of contributors, commit history, and checked the repository to see if there were any reference files detailing contributing the the project.

## libpng (instance 398)

This project only has commits from the owner of the repository, there are no other contributors listed, no pull requests from any other people, and no information in the reposistory about how to contribute to the repository. Based on these observations, I have determined that the project is not accepting contributions.

## qemu (instance 6)

This project has no commits or contributors listed in the repository, but it has a file claming that it is currently accepting contributions as well as a  google groups where there seem to be many active people sending in contributions (there have been 3 contributions submitted for review in the past week). Based on this criteria, I believe this project is accepting contributions.

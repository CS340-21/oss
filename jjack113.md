# Sprint 1
My projects are opencv (https://github.com/opencv/opencv) and Qt5 (https://github.com/CdTCzech/Qt5). 
I examined the commit history, the number of open and closed pull requests, and the number of open and
closed issues, contributors, and the latest project release to determine if the project was active. 

### opencv (instance 1337)
When I reviewed this project, it had been updated 20 minutes prior. It has 78 pull requests, all of which are
open. It has 1,861 open issues and 5,975 closed issues. There are also 30,240 commits and the lastest project 
release was December 20, 2020. There are a total of 1,296 contributors. From this information, I have concluded 
that this is an open and active project. 

### Qt5 (instance 1319)
The last commit to this project was February 11. It only has 3 pull requests, but all three are open. It has no 
issues. There are a total of 12 commits, all from a single person, so I assume that person is the only 
contributor. There is no date for the latest project release. From this information, I have concluded that this is
and open and active project.

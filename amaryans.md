Sprint 3
For this I was assigned instance 1247 - stepmania/stepmania

This github has not been updated in over nine months, which told me that more than likely it had not been updated to include this patch. After further investigation of the files, neither file is in the repository stepmania which means that the bug can still be exploited on this version, and therefore still vulnerable.

For this I was also assigned instance 364 - Totalcross/totalcross

A similar test was done simply to see if they had added the patch, and again these files were not present so therefore the project is still vulnerable and can be exploited.

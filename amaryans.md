For this I was assigned instance 1247 - stepmania/stepmania

Sprint 1
This project seems to be open and relatively active as there have been pull requests made in the last year as well as commits as recently as 2 months ago. The project is not incredibly active as there are 110 contributers and so few commits, but it is still being revised

Sprint 2
Based on the fact that there are many contributors and the project is slowly making progress (last commit was 2 months ago) we can assume that it is still accepting contributions, but the continuation of the project does not seem to be a priority.

Sprint 3

This github has not been updated in over nine months, which told me that more than likely it had not been updated to include this patch. After further investigation of the files, neither file is in the repository stepmania which means that the bug can still be exploited on this version, and therefore still vulnerable.

Sprint 4

Sprint 5

For this I was also assigned instance 364 - Totalcross/totalcross

Sprint 1
This projects is still active, and there have been commits made withing the last 7 days. There are only 15 contributors but with 8 recent pull requests we can see that this project is indeed active. 

Sprint 2
This project does seem to be accepting contributions considering there are only two PRs open from last year, and with commits being made so recently it is very active. 

Sprint 3

A similar test was done simply to see if they had added the patch, and again these files were not present so therefore the project is still vulnerable and can be exploited.

# Sprint1

For both assigned projects, I looked at the quantity and dates of forks, commits, comments, pulls, issues(opened/closed), milestones, and any other additions to the project to determine if the project is stil active.

JKolodziejczak/povray-polar - Everything done to for this project was done 10 months ago. There has been no update in any of the aformentioned listted material. This project is either on hiatus or dead, but it is definitely not currently active.

gdregalo/browser-android-tabs - Everything done to for this project was done 12 months ago. There has been no update in any of the aformentioned listed material. This project is either on hiatus or dead, but it is definitely not currently active.

brave/browser-android-tabs - This leads to an error 404, suggesting this person is either no longer attached to the project or is hidden.


# Sprint 2

For both assigned projects, I checked to see whether or not a project still accepts contributions

JKolodziejczak/povray-polar - I could not find the owner's email to contact them so I created a test file to see whether or not is accepted or rejected. I did also find a team email address to contact. So far, no response on whether or not contributions can be added so the answer is probably no.

gdregalo/browser-android-tabs - Using the method found on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12686545/how-to-leave-a-message-for-a-github-com-user, I was able to find the email addressess of several of the contributers, with exception to the owner of the project. So far, no response on whether or not it is still accepting contributions so the answer is probably no.

# Sprint 3

For both assigned projects, I checked to see whether or not a project contains vulnerabilites in 2 files: pngpread.c and pngrutil.c

JKolodziejczak/povray-polar - By copying and pasting their files and comparing it to the fixed version, the two files have not been updated and still contain the vulenerabilities.

**Sprint 1**

The two projects I have been assigned are "MVStudio" (which uses libpng) and 
"qemu" which looks like it is simply an outdated, copied over version of QEMU (which is probably why it still has the QEMU vulnerability).

*MVStudio*
- This project seems to still be somewhat active.
- The last commit as of me writing this was 13 days ago, which is fairly recent.
- There seems to be only one contributor, the main developer.
- There is not much community discussion, but there has been some in recent months.
- Based on these criteria, I would say that this project IS still active (just not super active).

*qemu*
- This project does NOT seem to be active.
- The first and last commit was made 11 months ago, which is not very recent.
- There is no community discussion whatsoever.
- Based on these criteria, I would say that this project is NOT active.



**Sprint 2**

*MVStudio*
- This project only has one contributor.
- There are no written contributing guidelines included in the repository.
- There is no pull request template.
- There is only one closed pull request, and it was from the main developer.
- For these reasons, I have concluded that the project is NOT accepting contributions.

*qemu*
- This project only has one contributor.
- There are no written contributing guidelines included in the repository.
- There is no pull request template.
- There has been only one commit ever, and it was 11 months ago.
- For these reasons, I have concluded that the project is NOT accepting contributions.



**Sprint 3**

*MVStudio*
	- I looked at the commit that fixed the libpng vulnerability and compared it to the MVStudio project's file that is supposed to contain the vulnerability. 
	- The changes made to the code in the libpng repository do NOT seem to be reflected in the MVStudio repository.
	- Based on this and the fact that the file containing the vulnerability has NOT been updated since the vulnerability was fixed, I can confirm that the vulnerability DOES still exist in this project. 

*qemu*
	- I looked at the commit that fixed the QEMU vulnerability and compared it to the 'qemu' project's file that supposedly contains the vulnerability. 
	- After comparing the lines that were changed to fix the vulnerability, I can confirm that the project DOES still have the vulnerability. 
	- The file containing the vulnerability has not been changed since it was fixed in the main QEMU repository.

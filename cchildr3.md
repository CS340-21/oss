# Sprint 1
I am looking at [instance 1105](https://bitbucket.org/hhrhhr/factorio-tools-lua/src/master/) for "Project 1" and [instance 3](https://bitbucket.org/andreyu/simple-viewer-gl/src/master/) for "Project 2." These projects use the libraries libpng and LZ4 respectively. For each project I used the following critera to determine if it is still active: number of participants, frequency of commits and issues, and enthusiams of discussion in the community.

### Factorio tools (Lua) (Instance 1105)
This project is a fork of [this repo](https://github.com/KirkMcDonald/factorio-tools) rewritten in Lua. It uses the [libpng](https://github.com/glennrp/libpng) graphics library. The only participant is Dmitry Zaitsev, who was maintaining this repo from 4/13/2020 until 6/13/2020 (the dates of his initial and final commits). As stated by the last commit, this project have been moved to a new repo leaving the old one "frozen." There are currently no open pull requests or community discussion. Since there has been no progress since June of 2020 and activity has halted on the "new" repo (last commit 7/27/20), I deem this project inactive.

### Simple Viewer GL (Instance 3)
This project is a "tiny image viewer" for Unix based on OpenGL. It utilizes the [LZ4](https://github.com/lz4/lz4) library for lossless compression. The only participant is Andrey Ugolnik, who has been mainting this project from 4/4/10 until 2/26/21. Commits usually occur several times a month with seemingly meaningful development updates. There are currently no open pull requests or community activity. There are numerous open issues (all assigned to Andrey, of course) and two main branches (main and development). Using the critera stated initially, I determine that this project is active.

# Sprint 1
I was assigned [ebf_stm32f407_batianhu_emwin_demo](https://github.com/Embedfire-emwin/ebf_stm32f407_batianhu_emwin_demo) and [Progression](https://github.com/LiamTyler/Progression). I looked at commit history, number of contributors, number of open/closed PR's, number of open/closed issues, and project releases to determine if the project was still in active developement.

### ebf_stm32f407_batianhu_emwin_demo Project (Instance 944)
# SP 1
This project handles PNG file processing. I determined that this project was not in active project based on the inactivity of the project. There no open or closed PR's or issues. The last commit was 7 months ago, and the only release was on April 30, 2019. Seems clear to me that this project is not in active developement.

# SP 2
This project does not seem to be accepting contributions, based on the fact that there is no documentation and only 3 contributors.

# SP 3
I conpared the files from the fix commit in libpng to the files in this project. It was incredibly difficult to say since the two utilities are written very differently, but I do not think this project accounts for user input length anywhere. So I think the vulnerability still exists.

### Progression Project (Instance 4)
# SP 1
This project is a C++ game engine for Linux and Windows. I determined that this project was still in active developement based on the very recent commit history, but the one contributor does not utilize PR's, issues, or releases.

# SP 2
This project also does not seem to be accepting contributions, with only one contributor and no issues, PR's, or conversations.

# SP 3
I conpared the files from the fix commit in LZ4 to the files in this project to determine that the vulnerability still exists in Progression.

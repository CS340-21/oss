# Sprint 1
I was assigned [ebf_stm32f407_batianhu_emwin_demo](https://github.com/Embedfire-emwin/ebf_stm32f407_batianhu_emwin_demo) and [Progression](https://github.com/LiamTyler/Progression). I looked at commit history, number of contributors, number of open/closed PR's, number of open/closed issues, and project releases to determine if the project was still in active developement.

### ebf_stm32f407_batianhu_emwin_demo Project (Instance 944)
This project handles PNG file processing. I determined that this project was not in active project based on the inactivity of the project. There no open or closed PR's or issues. The last commit was 7 months ago, and the only release was on April 30, 2019. Seems clear to me that this project is not in active developement.

This project does not seem to be accepting contributions, based on the fact that there is no documentation and only 3 contributors.

### Progression Project (Instance 4)
This project is a C++ game engine for Linux and Windows. I determined that this project was still in active developement based on the very recent commit history, but the one contributor does not utilize PR's, issues, or releases.

This project also does not seem to be accepting contributions, with only one contributor and no issues, PR's, or conversations.

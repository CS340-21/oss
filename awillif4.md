# Sprint 1
I was assigned [libpng](https://github.com/glennrp/libpng) and [lz4](https://github.com/lz4/lz4). I looked at commit history, number of contributors, number of open/closed PR's, number of open/closed issues, and project releases to determine if the project was still in active developement.

### libpng Project (Instance 944)
This project handles PNG file processing.

I determined that this project was not in active project based on the 33 open PR's, 86 open issues, the latest commit is from May 24, 2020, there are 5 branches from the same contributor that are 4 or more years old, and the lastest release was on Jul 16, 2018. There are several contibutors (44), but nothing has been commited in almost a year. Seems clear to me that this project is not in active developement.

### lz4 Project (Instance 4)
This project claims to be a lossless compression algorithm, providing compression speed > 500 MB/s per core, scalable with multi-cores CPU.

I determined that this project was still in active developement based on the very recent and frequent commit history, the 101 contributors, only 1 open PR, and only 11 open issues which have comments on them, the latest release was on Nov 16, 2020. This project appears to still be in active development.

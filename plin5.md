# Sprint 1
I am assigned to project 918 (openwebrtc-m75) and project 4.
## Project 918: openwebrtc-m75
There is one contributor for this repo, and there are no issues or pull requests. 
The only activity was the first commit that happened 9 months ago on June 13, 2020, by the same user. 
There are 8 commits in total made in just one day. It looks like the project has been inactive since the day it was made. 
## Project 4: vtf-xen
These is one contributor for this project with no issues or pull requests. There are no issues or pull requests. 
The initial repo started 14 months ago and was updated until 10 months ago when it went on a hiatus. 
The project seems to be inactive as well after their 7 month activity. 

# Sprint 2
## Project 918: openwebrtc-m75
Based on the conclusions from Sprint 1, Project 918 looks to not be accepting contributions. 
The repo does have an AUTHOR directory where they provided names and emails of contributors. 
It can be assumed that at one point in time, the repo was accepting contributions. 
## Project 4: vtf-xen
Project 4 also seems to be not accepting contributions on this github repo. There has been strictly one contributor for the 
entire duration of the project. The README does provide adequate information for where one would get started on working with xen. 

# Sprint 3
## Project 918: openwebrtc-m75
A complete project seemed to be committed to the repo at once, but never touched again. No issues or pull requests were made. 
No vulnerabilities were found. 
## Project 4: vtf-xen
This project once contained a shared variable that was problematic. It was removed, so the vulnerability is gone. 
Upon reviewing the various patch files, no other vulnerabilities seem to be present. 

# Sprint 4
Since no vulnerabilities were found for both projects, there is no reason to create a patch. 

# Sprint 5
Since no patches were required, no pull requests were necessary. 

# Sprint 6
Due to inactivity of both projects, the lack of vulnerabilities, and pull requests, no questions were asked.

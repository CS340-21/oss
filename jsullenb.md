I was assigned Libpng and QEMU.  I looked at each project's commit history, open/closed pull requests and open/closed issues, and project releases to determine if the projects were still actively in developement.

Libpng (instance 478)
Libpng is a platform-independent library for images in the PNG (portable network graphics) format.  
This project appears to be somewhat active, but not very active, and the team behind the project tends to be pretty unresponsive.  The most recent commits were 5 days ago, but those appear to have been very minor bugfixes, with the last major commits being several months ago.  However, the most recent pull requests are from the last week, and it does appear there are still plenty of open pull requests.  The pull requests that do get closed take a long time to be closed.  The most recent issues were opened two weeks ago and have yet to be closed.  There are a lot of unclosed issues.

QEMU (instance 3)
QEMU is a generic and open source machine & userspace emulator and virtualizer.
This project is very active.  There are many commits within the last day.  There are zero open issues or pull requests, and all of the closed pull requests appear to have been closed within a few days of being opened.

Sprint 1 & 2: 

To determine if the OSS projects I have been assigned are still active, I will analyze the recency of the latest commits and issues, the quantity of recently opened and closed issues, and the project's milestones and releases.

To determine if these OSS projects are accepting contributions, I will analyze the number of contributors, the recency of contributions, and the activity on the issues and author responses.

I have been assigned two issues:

1. Issue 118: https://github.com/Amriaa/Blink-and-Sink-Frontend
Amriaa/Blick-and-Sink-Frontend is the repository of a submission to Oxford Digithon (a local Oxford, UK Hackathon) for the May 2020 competition.  All pushes to the repository were made in a two-day period and no edits or issues have been made since then.  There are only two contributors and no open issues or pull requests.  This leads me to believe that the project has been completed, is inactive, and not accepting contributions.

2. Issue 966: https://github.com/MokshChoudhary/Drishti
MokshChoudhary/Drishti has one contributor, no issues, and no pull requests.  The repository was created about a year ago and seems to integrate Microsoft Visual Studio with the opencv library.  The repository was only active the day that it was created and one day about 6 months later. There is very limited documentation. This leads me to believe that the project has been completed or abandoned, is inactive, and not accepting contributions. 

Given the above criteria-- my projects are not accepting contributions.

Sprint 3:

1. Issue 118: https://github.com/Amriaa/Blink-and-Sink-Frontend
This repositories pngpread.c and pngrutil.c file have a large number of changes. I believe that the bug has been fixed. 

2. Issue 966: https://github.com/MokshChoudhary/Drishti
This repositories files haven't been changed too too significantly, especially as it relates to the particular error, so I am lead to believe that the vulnerabilities still exist.

Sprint 4: 

1. Issue 118: https://github.com/Amriaa/Blink-and-Sink-Frontend
This repositories pngpread.c file has a large number of changes.  I am afraid to change it because I am concerned I might create a cascade of errors.  Similarly, this repositories pngrutil.c file has a large number of changes, too many for me to deal with at once.

2. Issue 966: https://github.com/MokshChoudhary/Drishti
This repositories pngpread.c file has only one change.  The change is an approximately 20 line change.  This repositories pngrutil.c file has a large number of changes, so I decided not to tackle all the issues.

Sprint 5:
Link to the pull request here: https://github.com/MokshChoudhary/Drishti/pull/2
The only pull request made was the one talked about with issue 118. While it would have been nice to be able to update the other code, it likely wouldn't have been possible without creating possible errors.

Sprint 6:
Super exciting!  My pull request was accepted and merged!

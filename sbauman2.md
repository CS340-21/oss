# Sprint 1

I was assigned instance 811 and 1299. I believe neither of these projects are active.

### bender647/asuswrt-382

The most recent (and only) pull request on this one is from March of last year, and it has not been accepted. This leads me to believe that this project is dead, or at least no longer accepting changes.

### zhujiadong666/PycharmWorkspace

This one returns a 404, so either has gone private or was deleted from github.

## Sprint 1 find new projets / sprint 2

Since none of these work, I've chosen instances 1028 and 1207

### DISTRHO/DISTRHO-Ports

This one seems active. There are issues that have been closed as recently as in the past month. It also seems like the project accepts contributions, as there are pull requests merged also within the last month.

### Try/Tempest

This one also seems active and accepting contributions. There are both pull requests and issues merged and closed within the past few months.

## Sprint 3

### DISTRHO/DISTRHO-Ports

This one I believe still has the vulnerability, buecause pngread.c does not contain the code that fixed the vulnerability

### Try/Tempest

This one looks like it still has the vulnerability, also because pngread.c does not contain the updated code from the the commit that fixed the vulnerability.

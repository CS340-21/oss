Project 605: Smart-Grid-Table

This project does not appear to be worked on anymore. It has not had any commits in 11 months, there are no remaining issues, and no branches other than master. This coupled that the fact that all the previous commits occurred within a two-month window, leads me to be confident that the project is no longer active.

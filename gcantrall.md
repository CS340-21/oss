Sprint 1

Project 605: Smart-Grid-Table

This project does not appear to be worked on anymore. It has not had any commits in 11 months, there are no remaining issues, and no branches other than master. This coupled that the fact that all the previous commits occurred within a two-month window, leads me to be confident that the project is no longer active.

Project 860: bill_statistics
This project has not had any commits in over a year. There are two pull request that were opened on October 13, 2020 and have still not been closed. Lastly there are not any issues that are currently open, so I believe this project is no longer active.

Sprint 2

It does not appear that either of the projects that I was assigned are intending to accept any more contributions. As stated for the previous step they appear to be inactive at the moment. 

Sprint 3 

Instance 605

This Projects potential vulnerability was rooted in an old version of lidpng. The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.6.32beta07 of the package, published on August 4 2017. The project is running version 1.6.32 published on August 24, 2017 so it appears that it has the vulnerability fixed. 

Instance 860 

This project had the same potential vulnerability however it is using 1.6.35 so the valnerability appears to have been fixed.

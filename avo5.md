Sprint 1

I have been assigned instance 953 and instance 14. The criteria I used include the following to determine if the projects are still active: the number of participants, the frequency of the commits and issues, and the amount of discussion.

libpng (Instance 953)
The project does not appear to be active. There are 47 participants, with only 8 different participants opening issues this year in 2021. There were also only 7 commits to the project this year as well. Also, there seem to be only a few people answering and discussing issues in the project.

QEMU (Instance 14)
The project does appear to be active. There are 1,124 participants, with 36 commits being pushed today, March 19, 2021. There is also a separate bug report page, with around 18 users posting and answering issues this month. There also seems to be active discussion for many bug reports in this page.

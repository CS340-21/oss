Sprint 1
Issue #974 (pub.mod) seems to be inactive. The most recent modification/contribution was 6 months ago. With much of the contributions being much older than that. Not completely sure what the project is, the readme has very little information. From the given readme it seems they are trying to port something from BlitzMax.

Issue #19 (1Engine) I believe is still active and looks to be accepting contributions. The most recent contribution was two weeks ago and there is some information about how/what to contribute. This project is a game engine for creating simple 2d games and possibly even 3d games.

Sprint 2
Issue #974 (pub.mod) likely is not accepting contributions because it has been inactive for over 6 months. However, there are open issues and they have been responded to within the past week or so. Based on responses to these issues by the owner of the repo they don't seem to be looking to improve what they have in the repo.

Issue #19 (1Engine) has 0 open issues and 0 closed issues. The readme states that the content of the repo is open for use on others' projects and they list requirements and prerequisites for use of the engine/contributions. With 0 open issues,the activity, and info given in the readme I am not sure that they are looking for contributors either.

Sprint 3
Issue #974 (pub.mod) has fixed the vulnerability involving libpng. The project is using a version of libpng that is not vulnerable. The most recent version of libpng that is vulnerable according to the CVE is 1.6.27. pub.mod uses libpng version 1.6.37. This change was made 14 months ago.

Issue #19 (1Engine) has also fixed the vulnerability. This project uses version 1.6.30. I found this information by going into the repos and looking for the libpng files. This project has a readme posted regarding libpng so they seem to be very aware of the potential vulnerabilities involved with libpng.

Instance #538 does not seem to be an OSS project. The most recent commits were made 7 months ago, there are no open or closed issues, and there are no pull requests.
Also, the project is in Lithuanian, which would be difficult to work with even if this was an open and active project.

Instance #1154 does appear to be an OSS project. It is an open source transportation simulation game. The repo on Github is a mirror to one located on their website

their site.

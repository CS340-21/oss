# Sprint 1
The two instances I am looking at are [instance 1182](https://github.com/glennrp/libpng) and [instance 15](https://github.com/qemu/qemu). The project for instance 
1182 is a graphics library written primarily in C. The project for instance 15 is a machine & userspace emulator and virtualizer primarily written in C. To 
determine if these two projects are active, I looked at the number of contributors, the recency of issues, the recency of pull requests, and the 
frequency of changes to the repository.

### github.com/glennrp/libpng (Instance 1182)
This project has 47 total contributors and several active contributors. There are several issues that have been open within the past month. 
Several pull requests have been resolved within the last 3 days. Changes to the repository have been made as recently as 5 days ago. These things lead me 
to believe that this project is active.

### github.com/qemu/qemu (Instance 15)
This project has more than 1000 total contributors and several active contributors. Although there are no open pull requests, there are several closed pull 
requests from the last month. There are several recent changes that have been made to the repository. One change having been made a day ago (03/17/2021). Other
changes have been made within the last few days. These things lead me to believe that this project is active.

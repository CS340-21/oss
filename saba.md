## Sprint 1
I was assigned [Orange](https://github.com/mis9ter/orange) (Instance 1016) and [cengizkandemir](https://github.com/cengizkandemir/uwmf) (Instance 1257).
By looking at their commit history, pull requests, open issues, and the number of recent contributors, I determined whether the projects were still active.

### Orange (Instance 1016)
*Inactive Project
There are 36 total commits and the most recent one was last month.
All commits are made by a single user, so they are probably not accepting
outside contributions.
There are no open issues and no pull resquests. 
Because of this I determined the project to be inactive.

### Unbiased Weighted Mean Filter (Instance 1257)
*Inactive Project
This project has 96 total commits, and the most recent commit was only a few days ago.
However, before this month, there had been no activity on the project in over a year.
Again there are no pull requests or open issues, and there is only a single contributor.
Because of all of this, even though there was a very recent string of commits, I would still consider this project inactive.

I had the following two instances assigned
### JleMyP/game_of_life-cpp
This project I'd say is not active. Only one user makes commits, and it has no open issues/pull requests. 
The last commit was 9 months ago, which was kind of recent, but since this project is being worked by a single person
9 months is kind of long.

### GiantVM/QEMU
This project is also not very active, but is moreso than the previous. Only 2 contributors but does have (2) open issues
as recent as 4 months ago. 4 months ago was also the most recent commit. 

For the purposes of this assignment I'd consider both of these projects to be 'inactive'.

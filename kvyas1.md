# Sprint 1

I have been assigned instance 712 and 1442. For this Sprint, we have been assigned to describe the criteria we used to determine if our OSS projects are still active. To see if my assigned projects were still active, I just looked at the date of previous commits and issues, as well as participation from users. From looking at the dates of the last commit for both my projects, I have concluded that they are both inactive.

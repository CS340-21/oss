# Sprint 1

I have been assigned instance 712 and 1442. For this Sprint, we have been assigned to describe the criteria we used to determine if our OSS projects are still active. To see if my assigned projects were still active, I just looked at the date of previous commits and issues, as well as participation from users. From looking at the dates of the last commit for both my projects, I have concluded that they are both inactive.  

# Sprint 2

For our second Sprint, we were to check if our assigned projects are still accepting contributions. To determine this, I simply checked the recency of contributions and checked for issues from various users. 

### Project 712:

After checking the number of contributors and commits made, I have concluded that the project does not accept contributors. All commits and issues were made from a single user. 

### Project 1442: 

I have concluded that the second project at one point did accept contributors. The project has over 15 forks and each forked repo has various commits from different users. However, despite accepting contributors at one point, the last commit made was in 2015, so it is safe to say the project does not have any recent contributors. 

# Sprint 3

The third Sprint required us to see if the vulnerability still exists. To determine this, I checked if or how the vulnerability was fixed and checked for the fix in the repo and issues to determine if it had been resolved.  

### Project 712:

No current vulnerabilities exist. I checked the commit history and all vulnerabilities were resolved. No issues currently existed either. 

### Project 1442:

My second assigned project has one potential vulnerability. I came to this conclusion because the last commit to the main branch was in February of 2015, and an issue was assigned by a fellow contributor on January of 2016. The issue is still open so a vulnerability may still exist. 

# Sprint 4

Fourth Sprint required us to produce patches for both projects. 

### Project 712:

Since this project is inactive, and no vulnerabilities were found, no patch was created.

### Project 1442:

Despite having a potential vulnerability, no patch was created because the issue still open (created on January 2016) required various files, which I do not have access to.

# Sprint 1

I have been assigned instance 712 and 1442. For this Sprint, we have been assigned to describe the criteria we used to determine if our OSS projects are still active. To see if my assigned projects were still active, I just looked at the date of previous commits and issues, as well as participation from users. From looking at the dates of the last commit for both my projects, I have concluded that they are both inactive.  

# Sprint 2

For our second Sprint, we were to check if our assigned projects are still accepting contributions. To determine this, I simply checked the recency of contributions and checked for issues from various users. 

### Project 712:

After checking the number of contributors and commits made, I have concluded that the project does not accept contributors. All commits and issues were made from a single user. 

### Project 1442: 

I have concluded that the second project at one point did accept contributors. The project has over 15 forks and each forked repo has various commits from different users. However, despite accepting contributors at one point, the last commit made was in 2015, so it is safe to say the project does not have any recent contributors.

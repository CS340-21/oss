# Sprint 1 - Are projects still active?

I was assigned the following instances:
* [930](https://github.com/captain-mayhem/captainsengine)
* [470](https://github.com/shiyuyullin/OpenGl_miniProgram)

### Instance 930 - Captain's Engine Game
This project is a cross-platform game engine with focus on classical point-and-click adventures. 
There are 1,147 commits and a wiki page which makes this project seem more active than others. The last
commit was August 20, 2020 which may suggest that this project isn't maintained/active anymore.

### Instance 470 - OpenGI_miniProgram
This repository contains a bunch of mini programs for the user to practice. It seems the folders contain labs from a school
or course as well as debugging tools. There have been 2 commits, so I'm assuming the user just uploaded her work after she was done with them.

# Sprint 2 - Are projects still accepting contributions?

### Instance 930 - Captain's Engine Game
There have been no commits since August 20, 2020, so I believe this project isn't accepting contributions anymore. The commits are minor around that time, indicating that the project is pretty much finished.

### Instance 470 - OpenGI_miniProgram
The last commit was on July 6, 2020 and it seems it was the initial commit. It looks like the user just dumped her contents onto github for storage and left them be. 


# Sprint 3 - Do vulnerabilities still exist?

### Instance 930 - Captain's Engine Game
By comparing the commits in the repository, it seems that the code has fixed most of its vulnerabilities. There are minor build fixes which don't indicate that many vulnerablities left to deal with, so I can conclude that the game is finished for the most part.

### Instance 470 - OpenGI_miniProgram
There's really no vulnerabilities as it's just simple class code of algorithms. The user indicates that this "project" is just for practice and there's nothing to really dive into. 
# Sprint 4

### Instance 930 - Captain's Engine Game
Because this game is up to date, there are no vulnerabilities.

### Instance 470 - OpenGI_miniProgram
As mentioned before, there's not really any vulnerabilities since it's just practice problems.

# Sprint 5

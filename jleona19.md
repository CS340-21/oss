# Sprint 1

I was assigned the following instances:
* [930](https://github.com/captain-mayhem/captainsengine)
* [470](https://github.com/shiyuyullin/OpenGl_miniProgram)

### Instance 930 - Captain's Engine Game
This project is a cross-platform game engine with focus on classical point-and-click adventures. 
There are 1,147 commits and a wiki page which makes this project seem more active than others. The last
commit was August 20, 2020 which may suggest that this project isn't maintained/active anymore.

### Instance 470 - OpenGI_miniProgram
This repository contains a bunch of mini programs for the user to practice. It seems the folders contain labs from a school
or course as well as debugging tools. There have been 2 commits, so I'm assuming the user just uploaded her work after she was 
done with them.

# Sprint 1

The projects I have been assigned are [Qt5-Genode](https://github.com/cproc/qt5#readme) and [Universal-Tools](https://github.com/utechnique/universal_tools).
For each project, I reviewed the repository, commit history, issues (open and closed), pull requests (open and closed), milestones (if any), 
and contributors. Through looking at these factors, I determined whether each project was still in active development. 

### Qt5 Project (Instance 1231)
This project is a port to allow [Qt5](https://www.qt.io/) to be used with [Genode](https://genode.org/) based operating systems. 
There are 15 total commits for the project from two contributors with the most recent being from Sep. 17, 2020. 
There are three open pull requests, but all are from bots to update dependencies. This project does not appear
to be in active development.

### Universal Tools (Instance 457)
This project is a light-weight cross-platform framework for c++ development. It does not use the STL or Boost 
libraries, though it provides much of the same functionality without any external dependencies. There are 115
total commits to the project, with the most recent being from March 10, 2021. There is only one contributor to
the project, and there is currently one active branch that is ahead of the master branch. This project appears 
to still be in active development.

For this project I was assigned, Libpng, a graphics library, and QEMU, a machine and userspace emulator and virtualizer. Libpng does not seem to be very active with almost everything in the repository not being updated in the last year, but QEMU does seem active with many commits in the last week. 

Libpng (Instance 1211)
This instance has to do with the chromium web browser and I concluded that this branch of the project is no longer active. There are no open issues and the most recent commit was 12 months ago. From what I could tell this project is inactive.

QEMU (Instance 1)
This instance appears to be an early version of the project and seems to have been resolved around a year or more ago. The most recent commits on this instance come from 12 months ago. These are no open issues so I believe this project is inactive.

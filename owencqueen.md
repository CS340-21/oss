# Open Source Assignments

## Sprint 1
I have been assigned [Instance 752](https://davidalanreid.github.io/output/347538efbdc21b8df684ebd92d37400b3ce85d55/vulnerable.hack.html) and [Instance 300](https://davidalanreid.github.io/output/347538efbdc21b8df684ebd92d37400b3ce85d55/vulnerable.hack.html). The criteria I have used to determine if these projects are active or not are shown below:

### Instance 752
This instance is from a repository named "One Thousand Years", and its a utility engine for game development. It has several contributors to the project as well as multiple branches where people have made contributions. However, the last
commit for this file was on May 25, 2020, about 10 months ago. While the project was active before then (lots of commits, merges, etc.), there has been little-to-no activity since that last commit, including no issues or pull requests. Because of this, I have determined
that this project is inactive.

### Instance 300
This instance is from a library named "DEngine-pcsv4", which is a low-level 3d graphics library written primarily in C++. This project is managed mainly by the repository owner, so all contributions must be made through pull request.
This project has distinct "releases", meaning that they release groups of edits to the code all at one time. The last of these releases was committed on Dec. 25, 2020, so within the last 3 months. If this repo accepted incremental pull
requests, this would normally indicate that the project is stagnant, but since there are distinct releases, this could indicate an active project. There have been 3 major releases in past year, so by this criteria, I determine that this
project is indeed active.

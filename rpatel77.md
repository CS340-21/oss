# Sprint 1

I reviewed the repository, commit history, issues, pull requests, and milestones to determine whether the project is still active or not. 

### Torque3D ([Instance 569](https://github.com/TorqueGameEngines/Torque3D))
**Active project.** 
There are 167 open issues and 57 closed ones. There are 15 open Pull Requests and 242 closed PRs.
The most recent PR is from 3 days agos. 
There are 4,695 commits in the history. 
Even though there are no milestones, that doesn't mean that it isn't active. Lots of groups don't use milestones. 

### Facial Recognition for Home Security System ([Instance 93](https://github.com/Mawueugiio/home))

**Project no longer active.**
There are 3 commits in the history and those were made in May 2020. 
There is also no discussion in the community, so no open/closed issues, PRs, or milestones. 
It seems that it is just a repository that stores somone's personal project to create a facial recognition system for their home that they don't plan 
on improving in the future. 


# Sprint 2 

### Torque3D ([Instance 569](https://github.com/TorqueGameEngines/Torque3D))
The project still accepts contributions as it just merged a PR 8 days ago. There are 82 total contributors listed on this project, so 
I assume that they will accept contributions as long as they were emailed about it first. First step is to get into contact with them in order to confirm
that they are allowing for more contributors. 

### Facial Recognition for Home Security System ([Instance 93](https://github.com/Mawueugiio/home))
Since the project is no longer an active project, they are not accepting contributions. There are only 2 contributors listed on this project.

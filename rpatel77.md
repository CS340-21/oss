# Sprint 1

I reviewed the repository, commit history, issues, pull requests, and milestones to determine whether the project is still active or not. 

### Torque3D ([Instance 569](https://github.com/TorqueGameEngines/Torque3D))
**Active project.** 
There are 167 open issues and 57 closed ones. There are 15 open Pull Requests and 242 closed PRs.
The most recent PR is from 3 days agos. 
There are 4,695 commits in the history. 
Even though there are no milestones, that doesn't mean that it isn't active. Lots of groups don't use milestones. 

### Facial Recognition for Home Security System ([Instance 93](https://github.com/Mawueugiio/home))

**Project no longer active.**
There are 3 commits in the history and those were made in May 2020. 
There is also no discussion in the community, so no open/closed issues, PRs, or milestones. 
It seems that it is just a repository that stores somone's personal project to create a facial recognition system for their home that they don't plan 
on improving in the future.

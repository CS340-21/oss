Sprint 1: To complete this sprint, I studied the history of commits, issues, pull requests, and completed milestones to figure out if the repositories were active or not. I was assigned instances 120 and 13.
Analyzing the projects assigned to me, they do not appear to be active. The dates for the last commits are not recent (both from early 2020), and not many new commits were added since the original creation. There is a lack of discussion amongst the community, and there are no active pull requests. I would not assume these projects are active.

Sprint 2: To complete this sprint, I studied the amount of total contributions and the number of contributors. Both projects had many contributors, but there were not many recent contributions. There is no active pull requests or issues assigned. Also, there are no community guidelines for new members of the project. These projects are likely not accepting new contributors.

Sprint 3: The vulnerabilities for these projects have not been fixed. This is clear because the date of the most recent patch to fix the vulnerabilities is not running with the most recent version of the code. By comparing the marked changes in pngpread.c and pngrutil.c, the vulnerabilities are still active.

Sprint 4: My forked repositories which fixes the vulnerabilities: 
https://github.com/mscarfo/qemu

Sprint 1: To complete this sprint, I studied the history of commits, issues, pull requests, and completed milestones to figure out if the repositories were active or not.
Analyzing the projects assigned to me, they do not appear to be active. The dates for the last commits are not recent, and not many new commits were added since the original creation. There is a lack of discussion amongst the community, and there are no active pull requests. I would not assume these projects are active.

Sprint 2: To complete this sprint, I studied the amount of total contributions and the number of contributors. Both projects had many contributors, but there were not many recent contributions. Based off this analysis, it is likely that the projects are being completed outside of github and the updates are then pushed to the project. This means they are likely not accepting contributors, as there is little activity on GitHub and most of the work is likely being completed elsewhere.

Sprint 3: The vulnerabilities for these projects are still open and exploitable. There is no updated code to fix the vulnerabilities.

I have been assigned instance 2 and instance 319. The link for instance 2 does not appear to be working, so I am unable to determine whether the project is still active. To determine if the following projects are active, I observed the date of the last commit, the number of contributors, and the presence of issues and milestones. To determine if the projects are accepting contributions, I analyzed the number of contirbutors and the recency of contributions and activity on issues/author responses.

## Project managexPence (Instance 319)
This project does not appear to be currently active, as the last commit to this repo was 10 months ago. While there are two contributors on this project, it appears that only one contributor made commits between December 10, 2018 to June 4, 2020. There are not any issues or milestones associated with this project. Based on this information, I believe this project is not active. Moreover, the fact that only one person has made contributions from late 2018 to mid 2020 leads me to believe that this project is not accepting contributions.

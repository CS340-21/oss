## Sprint 1
I have been assigned instance 2 and instance 319. The link for instance 2 does not appear to be working, so I am unable to determine whether the project is still active. To determine if the following projects are active, I observed the date of the last commit, the number of contributors, and the presence of issues and milestones. To determine if the projects are accepting contributions, I analyzed the number of contirbutors and the recency of contributions and activity on issues/author responses.

Project managexPence (Instance 319)
This project does not appear to be currently active, as the last commit to this repo was 10 months ago. While there are two contributors on this project, it appears that only one contributor made commits between December 10, 2018 to June 4, 2020. There are not any issues or milestones associated with this project. Based on this information, I believe this project is not active. Moreover, the fact that only one person has made contributions from late 2018 to mid 2020 leads me to believe that this project is not accepting contributions. 

## Sprint 2
To determine if the projects are accepting contributions, I analyzed the number of contirbutors and the recency of contributions and activity on issues/author responses.

Project managexPence (Instance 319)
There are only two contributors on this project. However, only one contributor made commits spanning from late 2018 to mid 2020. The fact that only one person has made contributions from late 2018 to mid 2020 leads me to believe that this project is not currently not active, nor accepting contributions. 

## Sprint 3
I was tasked with checking vulnerabilities related to libpng, the popular graphics library. To determine if vulnerabilities still exist, I referenced commit 347538efbdc21b8df684ebd92d37400b3ce85d55 and cross-checked it with each path's instance. 

Project managexPence (Instance 319)
Path: AndroidStudioProjects/svn/manageXPence/.svn/pristine/8b/8b2d6da0e389eabba1d24edf5758c6ba7a3d9099.svn-base. The last update in png 1.6.18 was in July 23, 2015. Based on this information, I believe the files were not updated with the changes and vulnerabilities may still exist.

Project SimpleSample11 (Instance 320)
Path: implib/DevIL/IL/libpng/pngpread.c and pngrutil.c. The last update in those files were in 2016, which is before the date in which commits were made to resolve those vulnerabilties. Based on this information, I believe that vulnerabilties may still exist. 

## Sprint 4
For both instances, I forked both repositories onto my account and added the vulnerability fix to pngpread.c. The commit for Instance 319 can be found [here] (https://github.com/shwang6/manageXPence/commit/ec676706fec79bc8429c8fd4645d64f2b36942a1), and the commit for Instance 320 can be found [here] (https://github.com/shwang6/SimpleSample11/commit/72c305030ff214a91dd17dfabf67a6d734972d44).

## Sprint 5

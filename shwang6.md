## Sprint 1
I have been assigned instance 2 and instance 319. The link for instance 2 does not appear to be working, so I am unable to determine whether the project is still active. I have used the data of the last commit, number of contributors, and the presence of issues and milestones to determine if the following projects are active.

## Project managexPence (Instance 319)
This project does not appear to be currently active, as the last commit to this repo was 10 months ago. While there are two contributors on this project, it appears that only one contributor made numerous commits between December 10, 2018 to June 4, 2020. There are not any issues or milestones associated with this project. Based on this information, I believe this project is not active.

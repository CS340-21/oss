Sprint 1: 
The two instances that I have been assigned are instances 1246 and 40. I identify if these projects are active by seeing pull timings, issues, milestones, commentary, or changes to the repository. 

Instance 1246: BennetLeff/Buzzsaw is  an extremely digital distortion pedal currently available as a VST3. There are no active branches and the most recent edit was 6 months ago. There were never any milestones or issues made. Together, this leads me to believe that this project is currently completed/inactive.

Instance 40: mcquui/root-hub leads to a 404 error. Other instances given on the site under that project name similarly lead to 404-errors. This leads me to believe that the project has either been dropped by mcquui or the project is completed/inactive.

Instance 41 (because 40 was a 404): HeyColton/PosterPro is a University of Rochester Final Project. There are no active branches and the last edit was 11 months ago. Given that this is a final project for a University Course and the course must have ended last Spring, I am lead to believe this this project is completed/inactive.


Sprint 2:

Instance 1246: This repository doesn't seem to be accepting contributions -- there is no documentation, there have only been two contributors, and the project is inactive.

Instance 41: This repository doesn't seem to be accepting contributions given by the fact that a) there is no documentation, b) there is only one contributor, and c) it is a school final project and as such should likely be limited by its group members.


Sprint 3:

Instance 1246: This repository's pngpread.c file is clearly missing the additions provided with the referenced commit and, therefore, is still suffering from the same vulnerability. A similar thing could be said about the pngrutil.c file, where certainly the locations of the code changes isn't shared. It follows that the vulnerabilities still existed and the files should be updated.

Instance 41: This repository's pngpread.c file is clearly missing the additions provided with the referenced commit and, therefore, is still suffering from the same vulnerability. A similar thing could be said about the pngrutil.c file. It follows that the vulnerabilities still existed and the files should be updated.

Sprint 4:

Instance 1246: BennetLeff/Buzzsaw's files have been edited significantly (with some variable name changes, too), so, as a result, I am nervous that producing a simple patch could break their abilities to use the files.

Instance 41: HeyColton/PosterPro's pngpread hasn't been changed significantly, so it can be patched. I merely copied the change to pngpread and put it in where directed. The second file, on the other hand, has been changed significantly so I am worried I could break it by updating it.

Sprint 5: 

Link to pull request for the single patch I did here: \href{https://github.com/HeyColton/PosterPro/pull/1}{Pull Request}. (Instance 41)

Sprint 1: 
The two instances that I have been assigned are instances 1246 and 40. I identify if these projects are active by seeing pull timings, issues, milestones, commentary, or changes to the repository. 

Instance 1246: BennetLeff/Buzzsaw is  an extremely digital distortion pedal currently available as a VST3. There are no active branches and the most recent edit was 6 months ago. There were never any milestones or issues made. Together, this leads me to believe that this project is currently completed/inactive.

Instance 40: mcquui/root-hub leads to a 404 error. Other instances given on the site under that project name similarly lead to 404-errors. This leads me to believe that the project has either been dropped by mcquui or the project is completed/inactive.
